    <h6>Brazilian Jiu-Jiutsu</h6>
    <img src="/images/bjj.png">
    <p>I enjoy bjj because it's a good way to excercise and stay healthy. Joining a bjj gym opens door to making new friends, build confident and discipline. To be able to submit someone without being submitted is extremely fun.</p>

  <div class="col-xs-4 hobby">
    <h6>Super Smash Brothers</h6>
    <img src="/images/smash.png">
    <p>Super Smash Bros is the only video game that I play. The only reason why I bought a Wii U is only for this game. Something about knocking your opponent off the edge of a cliff is so rewarding!</p>

  <div class="col-xs-4 hobby">
    <h6>Star Trek</h6>
    <img src="/images/startrek.png">
    <p>Call me a nerd, but I think Star Trek is awesome! The problems that the characters in the show face are very similar to the problems we face today. It is amazing how old this show is, but how ahead of it's time it is.</p>
